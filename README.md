# FerdApp


Meet Ferdinando Coluni, he was my teammate during that challenge at Apple Developer Academy. 
In that challenge, we had to describe one of our teammate by developing an app.

In my case, I choose to create a basic app with a tab bar Controller that show for each tab bar item show specific details of Ferdinando.
